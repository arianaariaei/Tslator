# Tslator: A Compiler for TSLANG

**Tslator** is a compiler for the **TSLANG** programming language, developed as part of the *Compiler Design* course at Babol Noshirvani University of Technology. TesLang is a simple C-like educational language featuring basic types, user-defined functions, arrays, conditionals, loops, and string handling.


**Instructor and Developer of TSLANG:** Dr. Gholami Rudi

## Language Features

TesLang supports the following data types:

- `int`: Integer values  
- `vector`: Arrays of integers  
- `str`: String literals  
- `mstr`: Multi-line strings  
- `bool`: Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

## Project Phases

This compiler was developed in three main phases:

### Phase 1 – Lexical Analysis
- Token recognition for all TesLang keywords and operators  
- Support for nested comments (`</ ... />`)  
- Error reporting for malformed tokens  

### Phase 2 – Parsing and Semantic Analysis
- PLY-based parser using a hand-written BNF grammar  
- Construction of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)  
- Symbol table construction with scoped entries  
- Type checking and semantic validation (e.g., return consistency, redefinition, undeclared use)  

### Phase 3 – IR Code Generation
- Emits low-level IR resembling assembly  
- Register allocation for variables and temporaries  
- Correct return handling and expression evaluation
